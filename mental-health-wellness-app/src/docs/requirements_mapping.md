Core Techniques

Belly Breathing (Diaphragmatic Breathing):
Sit or lie comfortably, place one hand on your belly.
Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly expand like a balloon (hand rises).
Exhale slowly through pursed lips (or mouth), feeling your belly fall.
Focus on the belly's movement, not your chest.

Inhale slowly for 4 counts.
Hold your breath for 4 counts.
Exhale slowly for 4 counts.
Wait for 4 counts before inhaling again.
4-7-8 Breathing:

Exhale completely through your mouth with a "whoosh" sound for 8 counts.
