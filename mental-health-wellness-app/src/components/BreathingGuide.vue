          <p>Belly Breathing (Diaphragmatic Breathing):
Sit or lie comfortably, place one hand on your belly.
Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your belly expand like a balloon (hand rises).
Exhale slowly through pursed lips (or mouth), feeling your belly fall.
Focus on the belly's movement, not your chest.</p>
